# Castlegate IT WP SEO Headings

SEO Headings provides a function that returns the text of a hidden, optimized heading for a WordPress theme:

~~~ php
<h1>
    <a href="<?= home_url('/') ?>">
        <img src="logo.png" alt="<?= cgit_seo_heading() ?>">
    </a>
</h1>
~~~

## Headings

The heading is returned as follows:

1.  The function can be passed an optional string parameter. If this is set and non-empty, the string will be returned unmodified. For example `cgit_seo_heading('Hello World')` will return `Hello World`.

2.  If the function parameter is not set, [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) is active, and the page is a single post of any public post type, the function will check the value of the SEO heading field of the current post. If this is non-empty, its value will be returned.

3.  If ACF is not active or if the SEO heading field is empty, the function will return the page title. If [Yoast](https://yoast.com/) is active, it will return the title generated by Yoast.

4.  If none of the above attempts have provided a non-empty string, the function will return the site name.

## Filters

The plugin provides the following filters for customization:

*   `cgit_seo_headings_post_types` An array of post types that should display the ACF SEO heading field. By default, this contains all public post types.

*   `cgit_seo_headings_menu_order` An integer representing the menu order of the ACF SEO headings field group. By default, this is set to 500.

*   `cgit_seo_headings_field_group_args` The complete array of parameters used to define the ACF field group. This is applied after the post type and menu order filters described above.

*   `cgit_seo_headings_move_yoast` A boolean that determines whether the Yoast fields should be moved from their default position above the ACF fields to a position below the ACF fields. The default value is `true`, which means the Yoast fields are moved to the bottom of the screen.
